# CCU_Advanced_Digital_Integrated_Circuit
## About this course
- This course aims to convey my techniques to design Mixed-Signal IC using current EDA tools. 
  In addition to learning EDA tools for SPICE and HDL co-simulation environment, all-digital PLL/DLL 
  design techniques will also be addressed and take as design examples.
- Upon completion of the course, I will be able to design their chip with Mixed-Signal blocks.
## About my assignments
